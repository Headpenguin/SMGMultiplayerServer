# Super Mario Galaxy Multiplayer Server

## Building
Just run `make release` and then run `bin/Debug/SMGServer`. Only works on Linux. Sorry if it doesn't build for you. Tell me in an issue the errors you get.    

## Running
We also provide pre-built releases. Hopefully that one works so you don't have to bother 
using the Makefile.

## Why?
For use with the [client](https://github.com/Headpenguin/SMGNetworkMultiplayer).
